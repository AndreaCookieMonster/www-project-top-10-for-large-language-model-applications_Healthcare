## Excessive Agency

**Author(s):**

Andy Smith

**Context:**

An LLM-based system is often granted a degree of agency - the ability to interface with other systems and undertake actions in response to a prompt. Some examples of external actions include:
 - Reading the contents of a web page (in order to then summarise the content for the LLM's response).
 - Querying the contents of a database (in order to include query results in the LLM's response).

It should be noted that an LLM does not have any agency itself, however applications can use the output from an LLM to trigger actions. Such capability is typically constructed as a 'plugin' or a 'tool'. The decision to perform external actions may be hard-wired by the system developer as part of a chain, or may be delegated to a LLM 'agent' to dynamically determine which are the most appropriate to take. Without restriction, any undesirable operation of the LLM (regardless of the root cause; be it hallucination, direct/indirect prompt injection, malicious plugin, poorly-engineered benign prompts, or just a poorly-performing model) may result in undesirable actions being taken.

**Description:**
Excessive Agency is the vulnerability that arises from allowing an LLM-based application to perform undesireable or damaging actions based upon the output from an LLM. There are several causes which may give rise to Excessive Agency:
 - Providing an LLM agent with access to plugins which perform functions that are not neeeded for the intended operation of the system.
 - Granting excessive permissions to an LLM plugin which are not needed for the intended operation of the system.
 - Failure to verify and approve high-impact actions.

Just like we never trust client-side validation in web-apps, LLMs should not be trusted to self-police or self-restrict; controls should be embedded in the APIs and plugins of that which the LLM-based system can call.

**Common Examples of Vulnerability:**

1. Undesirable Actions Performed: An LLM-system performs unintended or undesirable actions, potentially leading to second order consequences on downstream systems and processes.

**How to Prevent:**

The following options can prevent Excessive Agency:

1. **Limit the actions/plugins** that LLM agents are allowed to call to only the minimum necessary, and be particularly wary of those which allow very open-ended actions to be performed (e.g., run a shell command, fetch a URL, etc).
2. **Reduce the permissions** that LLM agents are granted to other systems the minimum necessary in order to limit the scope of undesirable actions. For example, an LLM agent that uses a product database in order to make purchase recommendations to a customer only needs read access to a 'products' table; it should not have access to other tables, nor the ability to insert, update or delete records. This should be enforced by applying appropriate database permissions for the identity that the LLM plugin uses to connect to the database.
3. **Utilise human-in-the-loop control** to require a human to approve all actions before they are taken. This may be implemented in a downstream system (outside the scope of the LLM system) or within the LLM plugin. See this example of adding a human-in-the-loop verification step into a LangChain tool: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/how_to/human_approval

**How to mitigate:**

The following options will not prevent Excessive Agency, but can limit the level of damage caused:

1. **Monitor the activity** of LLM plugins and downstream systems to identify where undesirable actions are taking place, and respond accordingly.
2. **Implement rate-limiting** to reduce the number of undesirable actions that can take place within a given time period, increasing the opportunity to discover undesirable actions through monitoring before significant damage can occur.

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

Scenario #1: An LLM-based personal assistant tool is granted access to an individualâ€™s mailbox via a plugin in order to summarise the content of incoming emails. The LMM is vulnerable to an indirect prompt injection attack, whereby a maliciously-crafted incoming email tricks the LLM into commanding the email plugin to send spam messages from the user's mailbox. This could be avoided by only granting the LLM pluging read-only access to the mailbox (not the ability to send messages), or by requiring the user to manually review and hit 'send' on every mail drafted by the LLM plugin. Alternatively, the damage caused could be reduced by implementing rate limiting on the mail-sending interface.

Scenario #2: An LLM-based customer service chatbot has a plugin to a payments system to provide service credits or refunds to customers in the case of complaints. The LLM's system prompt instructs it to limit refunds to no more than one month's subscription fee, however a malicious customer engineers a direct prompt injection attack to convince the LLM to issue a refund of 100 years of fees, which the LLM payments plugin dutifuilly carries out. This could be avoided by implementing the 'one month max' limit within the payments plugin or downstream API, rather than relying on the LLM to honour the limit in its system prompt.

**Disambiguation**

There is a degree of overlap between Excessive Agency and several other LLM Top-10 v0.9 candidates. The below is an attempt to call out the key differentiators between those other items and Excessive Agency. (_Note: these statements require validation with the teams working on those other items._)

Versus Overreliance:
> **Overreliance** is a weakness in how humans use LLM-based systems (e.g., a news website generates articles using a LLM, and staff copy-paste the output online without properly fact-checking the output.
> 
> **Excessive Agency** is a weakness in how LLM-based systems use the output from the LLM model itself (e.g., in the news website example above, Excessive Agency may occur if the article generation system can automatically publish articles online without any human involvement).

Versus Insecure Output Handling
> **Insecure Output Handling** involves malicious output being created by a LLM, which is then consumed by a downstream system without proper sanitisation.
> 
> **Excessive Agency** involves undesirable actions being taken by a LLM in a downstream system due to excessive permissions.

Versus Prompt Injection:
> **Prompt Injection** is the main trigger for driving an LLM to behave in an undesirable way.
>
> **Excessive Agency** allows a misbehaving LLM (be it through prompt injection or other means) to undertake undesirable actions in downstream systems.
