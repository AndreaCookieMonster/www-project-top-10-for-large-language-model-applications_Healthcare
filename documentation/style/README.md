# OWASP Top 10 For LLM Style Guide

**Technical Writing Style Guide for the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs Project**

This collection of documentation provides guidelines for technical writers on
ways to format their content for use with the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs project. The
intent is to help ensure consistent formatting throughout the various documents,
diagrams, and other information the project generates.


**General Style Guidelines**

At a very high level, the following guidelines can be applied:

* Use Markdown formatting for content where possible.
* Use clear and concise language.
* Define any technical terms or acronyms that you use.
* Proofread your contributions carefully before submitting them.

## Contents

The sections below provide further guidance and details:

1. [General](./general.md): general style information that can be applied to content
created throughout the various components that the Top 10 for LLMs creates.
2. [Entries](./entries.md): guidance on styling specific to the creation and

3. [Branding](./branding.md): guidelines to individuals and organizations that wish

## A Note on Markdown

Much of the content for the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs project is formatted using Markdown.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows us to create formatted text
using a plain text editor. It is a popular choice for technical writing because
it is easy to learn and use, and it can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, and
other formats.

To format text using Markdown, you use special characters and symbols to indicate
how you want the text to be displayed. For example:

* to make text **bold**, you surround it with two asterisks like `**this**`
* To make text *italic*, you surround it with one asterisk, like `*this*`
* To create a `code block`, you indent the code by four spaces or surround it with
  three backticks like ` ```this``` `.
