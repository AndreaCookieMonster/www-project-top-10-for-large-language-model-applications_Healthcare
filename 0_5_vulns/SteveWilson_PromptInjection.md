## Prompt Injection 

**Author(s):**

Steve Wilson

**Description:**

Prompt Injection is a vulnerability where an attacker influences the input to a Large Language Model (LLM) to guide its output in a malicious manner. This can lead to the generation of inappropriate content, disclosure of sensitive information, or unwanted system behavior.

**Labels/Tags:**

- Label: "Input Manipulation"
- Label: "Prompt Injection"

**Common Examples of Vulnerability:**

1. Example 1: An attacker provides an input that tricks the LLM into generating harmful or inappropriate content.
2. Example 2: The LLM is coaxed into generating sensitive information, such as internal details of its training data.
3. Example 3: The LLM is manipulated to output instructions that lead to unwanted system behavior, such as running malicious scripts.

**How to Prevent:**

1. Prevention Step 1: Implement robust input validation and sanitization methods to identify and filter out potential malicious inputs.
2. Prevention Step 2: Limit the exposure of sensitive information during the LLM training process.
3. Prevention Step 3: Regularly update and fine-tune the LLM to improve its ability to handle potentially harmful inputs.

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

Scenario #1: An attacker manipulates the LLM to generate inappropriate content, which is then published on a public platform, leading to reputational damage.

Scenario #2: The attacker tricks the LLM into disclosing sensitive information about its training data, which the attacker then uses for further exploits.

**Author Commentary (Optional):**

While Large Language Models offer significant benefits, their security implications, including vulnerabilities like prompt injection, should be carefully considered. Regular updates, robust input validation, and careful design can help mitigate these risks.
