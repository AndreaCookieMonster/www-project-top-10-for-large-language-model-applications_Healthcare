Dear Working Group,

I'd like to share a mock press release about our OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications project. This document is being shared with you not as a final or public marketing document, but as a tool to help us align our thinking and direction around our common task. This method of drafting a 'press release first' is a technique borrowed from Amazon’s approach to product development and helps us focus on the end goal from the user's perspective.

The press release is intended to paint a picture of what we want to achieve, and the impact we hope our work will have on developers using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This ties closely to the [charter document](Charter) recently created, as both tools serve to shape our focus, and set clear, forward-looking goals. The charter lays out our path, and this draft press release provides an envisioned destination.

Please review the attached press release draft and consider how it aligns with our objectives as laid out in the charter, and the tasks we undertake as a group.

Remember, this is a tool for us - a guiding star - not a binding prediction. It will inevitably be revised as we make progress and gain a deeper understanding of the unique challenges and potential solutions within the scope of LLM Applications.

# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Introducing the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications Project: Ensuring the Security and Safety  of Applications Powered by Large Language Models like GPT and Google's BERT

## San Francisco, CA – July 20, 2023
Today, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is pleased to announce the launch of the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications project.  The list encompassess the most important security vulnerabilities as they relate to applications being built using large language models.   This initiative focuses on providing valuable guidance to developers who are building applications leveraging LLM technologies, such as OpenAI's GPT Series and Google's Bard, which are causing increased interest in the field of artificial intelligence.

"Enterprises are increasingly using Large Language Models for a wide variety of applications, and ensuring the security of these applications is paramount," said Steve Wilson, Project Leader for OWASP and cybersecurity expert at Contrast Security. "Our goal with this project is to provide a reliable and comprehensive resource for developers to create secure applications embedding artificial intelligence."

Jane Diaz, a software engineer who frequently works with LLMs, shared, "The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications has become an essential resource in my toolkit. It not only makes me aware of the most critical  vulnerabilities I need to be aware of but also provides actionable recommendations  to ensure my applications are secure and reliable."

John Smith, CTO at AI Tech Solutions, a leading company in LLM technology, stated, "We believe the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications is a significant stride in the right direction for our industry. It not only promotes safer use of LLMs in application development but also provides our customers with much-needed assurance about the security of applications built using our technology."

This project seeks to highlight the crucial security risks associated with using LLMs, focusing on actionable security and safety vulnerabilities rather than core properties of LLMs. Understanding potential vulnerabilities and how these may differ from traditional application security is key to this project.

"By creating this Top 10 list, we're helping to pave the way for safer applications powered by Large Language Models," added Wilson. "We look forward to the positive impact this project will have on the community."
