# Phase 3 Instructions for the Expert Group

Dear Team,

**Phase 2** was highly successful.  We built 43 high quality entires in Sprint 1 and then narrowed to a new Top 2 in Phase 2. Phase 3 will again be divided into two "sprints" each lasting one week. Our objective during this phase is to generate version 1.0 of our Top 10 list - completing the initial phase of the project

## Sprint 1: Getting to the 0.9 Release Candidate
**Dates: July 1 to July 15**

In this sprint, we will take the quality entries that were created for 0.5 and tune them to make them better.

There are four ways you can contribute now:

* Post comments to the Slack channel
* Post comments to the [Brainstorming](brainstorming) area
* Link to external [Commentary](commentary) you write
* Team up on improving an Entry

First, we welcome commentary (on any platform) about the 0.5 list as a whole and how it could be better.  If you find or post commentary, please [link it here](commentary).  You can also post comments on the [Brainstorming](brainstorming) page.

[0.9 Vulns Directory](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/tree/main/0_9_vulns)

We're asking the authors of the selected 0.5 entries to build groups of interested expert to bulletproof and tune their entries.  In this way we'll ensure we have the best possible descriptions and guidance.  Updates to your entries can be submitted to he 0.9 directory via Pull Request.

It's suggested that leads form a Slack Channel with the name following the following patter #team-llm-VULN_NAME and invite others from the group to participate in review and suggestions.

## Sprint 2: Getting to 1.0
**Dates: July 16 to July 30**

Sprint 1 was a big success with dozens of entry submissions.  Now we need to review, evaluate and grade them to facilitate narrowing of the list.

After a round of survey data on the entries, we're now tuning each as we prepare for the 1.0 version.  Suggestions can be made on any entry in the corresponding Slack channel for each sub-team.
